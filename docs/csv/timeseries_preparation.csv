k_means,The k-means algorithm clusters the time periods (see period) in such a way; that the squared deviation of the cluster centers is minimal. From the time periods of one cluster the **mean** is calculated and returned as reference period of the cluster. For the decision the vector of a single parameter (see criterion) over the period duration is considered [1].,number of sample periods per cluster. The number of clusters equals the number of returned reference days.,Clustering criterion to be considered (temperature; dhi; heat demand; electricity demand),Period length to be clustered (hours; days; or weeks),--
k_medoids,The k-medoids algorithm clusters the time periods (see period) in such a way; that the squared deviation of the cluster centers is minimal. From the time periods of one cluster the **medoid** is calculated and returned as reference period of the cluster. For the decision the vector of a single parameter (see criterion) over the period duration is considered [1].,number of sample periods per cluster. The number of clusters equals the number of returned reference days.,Clustering criterion to be considered (temperature; dhi; heat demand; electricity demand),Period length to be clustered (hours; days; or weeks),--
slicing A, every n-th period is **selected and considered** within the modeling, index = n (every n-th period is selected in the modeling),--,length of periods to be sliced (hours; days; weeks),--
slicing B,every n-th period is **deleted and removed** from the modeling, index = n (every n-th period is removed),--,length of periods to be sliced (hours; days; weeks),--
downsampling A,Adaption of the temporal *resolution*. Every n-th period (selected by index column) is **used** for the modeling. For example; the resolution can be changed from a 1-hourly to a 3-hourly (index = 3) temporal resolution [1].,index = n (setting the new resolution),--,--,--
downsampling B, Adaption of the temporal *resolution*. Every n-th period (selected by index column) is **deleted** for the modeling. ,index = n (determination of the time steps to be deleted),--,--,--

heuristic selection,representative time periods of a time series are selected from certain selection criteria, applied selection scheme (available schemes are listed within the sesmg folder SESMG\program_files\technical_data\hierarchical_selection_schemes.xlsx,--,length of periods to be selected (days or weeks), With respect to the selected pattern; it must be selected; whether representative periods or seasons (4) or months (12) are selected.
