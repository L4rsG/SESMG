Examples
==============
For the SESMG, a number of examples can be found in `this directory <https://github.com/SESMG/SESMG-Examples>`_. Please make sure that the version indexed with the file/folder name matches your version of the SESMG. It is recommended to take a look at the mathematical graph theory before starting with the examples. Especially the terms sources, sinks, transformers, storages and buses should be understood. Further information can be found `here <https://spreadsheet-energy-system-model-generator.readthedocs.io/en/latest/01.01.00_structure_of_energy_systems.html>`_. In the following, some examples are explained in more detail.

Example 1: Simulation and optimization of a single family house
---------------------------------------------------------------
The template of the model definition (.xlsx) for this exercise you can find `here <https://github.com/SESMG/SESMG-Examples/blob/main/SESMG-v1.0.x-Examples/Task_1_template_model_definition.xlsx>`_. You can find the completed
model definition with solutions `here <https://github.com/SESMG/SESMG-Examples/blob/main/SESMG-v1.0.x-Examples/Task_1_solution_model_definition.xlsx>`_ and the graphical solution for each task `here <https://github.com/SESMG/SESMG-Examples/tree/main/SESMG-v1.0.x-Examples>`_. Your graphical results can be found directly in the Result Processing page at the menu point Energy System Graph. This example is intended as an introduction and has an exercise character.


Example 1a: Simulation of a single family house
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The Müller family has three children and lives in a single-family house with 180 m\ :sup:`2`. They are planning to adapt the energy supply of their house. The entire heating demand of the family is currently provided by a gas heating system. To cover their electricity needs, the Müllers decided last year to install a PV system on the roof of the house. The rest of their electricity needs are met conventionally by connecting to the grid.

Known data:
^^^^^^^^^^^
+---------------------+---------------+
| Data                | Value         |
+=====================+===============+
| Electricity Demand  | 5 100 kWh     |
+---------------------+---------------+
| Heat Demand         | 32 000 kWh    |
+---------------------+---------------+
| PV System           | 5 kWp         |
+---------------------+---------------+

Simplification:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- The PV system should be regarded as a new investment, as only a small portion of the depreciated to a small extent
- Using the time series simplification "Slicing A" with 4 days (for hole example 1)

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- Activate the given components via the column "active" as binary input. 0 = off, 1 = on
- Simulate the given energy system
	- To find out how to start a simulation, click `here <https://spreadsheet-energy-system-model-generator.readthedocs.io/en/latest/02.02.00_application.html#main-application>`_
- The graphical solution for task 1a can be found `here <https://github.com/SESMG/SESMG-Examples/blob/main/SESMG-v1.0.x-Examples/Task_1a_graphical_solution.png>`_.

.. attention::

	- After each change you have to save and upload the model definition again
	- Simulation: Min. and max. investment capacity identical. You use the same button for simulation as for optimization.

Example 1b: Cost optimization of the energy system
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
From the results of the simulation of the single-family house, it can be concluded that it makes sense to incorporate additional technologies in order to reduce the cost of energy supply. In this example, the following technologies are available:

<<<<<<< HEAD
- Air source heat pump (ASHP) with max. 20 kW

	- The electricity for a heat pump is purchased at a different price than the normal energy purchase. Therefore, two different buses are used.
	- Simulation (Example 1a): Min. and max. investment capacity identical
	- Optimization (Example 1b): Interval between min. and max. investment capacity

Optimization task: 
>>>>>>> master
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- Optimise the industrial company with new parameters
- Search for a suitable model in the database and enter it in the same way in the table. The required data can be found in the subpackage "`windpowerlib <https://github.com/wind-python/windpowerlib/blob/dev/windpowerlib/oedb/turbine_data.csv>`_".
- The graphical solution for task 2c can be found `here <https://github.com/SESMG/SESMG-Examples/blob/main/SESMG-v1.0.x-Examples/Task_2c_graphical_solution.png>`_.

.. note::

	- The surplus electricity can be sold at a tariff of 0.057 €/kWh
	- The wind turbine is designed (in this example) as a binary decision. This means that it is is either designed completely or not at all
	- To do this, you must create the plant as a "non-convex investment". You activate this with 0 or 1 in the corresponding cell
	- The costs are summarised in a periodic cost of 100 €/kW*a

Example 2d: Optimization of an industrial company part III
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The entire vehicle fleet of Schmiede GmbH is to be electrified within the next 5 years. This will not change the driving behavior. The resulting load profile was determined in a preliminary study. This is available in standardized form. Schmiede GmbH has 16 vehicles. The charging power is assumed to be 10 kW.

Optimization task:

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- Optimise the industrial company with new parameters
- Create the vehicle fleet as another consumer (sink)
- The graphical solution for task 2d can be found `here <https://github.com/SESMG/SESMG-Examples/blob/main/SESMG-v1.0.x-Examples/Task_2d_graphical_solution.png>`_.

.. note::

	- You can find the normalised time series `here <https://github.com/SESMG/SESMG-Examples/blob/main/SESMG-v1.0.x-Examples/Task_2_vehicle_fleet_normalised_load_response.xlsx>`_. Insert it into the worksheet "timeseries". The column must have the same name as your sink with the addition .fix
	- Since this is a normalized time series, the "nominal value" of the sink must be determined on the basis of the maximum possible charging capacity of the vehicle fleet. To achieve this, create a single sink with a nominal value of 160 kW
