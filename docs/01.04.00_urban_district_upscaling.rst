Urban District Upscaling
************************

The Urban District Upscaling Tool (US-Tool) is suitable to efficiently model large
neighborhoods. With the help of the tool, the upscaling sheet (us-sheet) and the
standard parameter sheet (sp-sheet) are merged into the *model_definition.xlsx*.
The *model_definition.xlsx* is the basis for the automatically created energy
system shown in section `upscaling model`_ and must be created for each energy
system model. In a model definition, each component is defined with respect to
its technical and economic parameters and design (e.g. efficiency,
GHG emissions, max. capacity). In addition to these standard parameters, users
must define model- or neighborhood-specific data (e.g. year of construction of
the buildings, heating network as an investment alternative) in the upscaling
sheet. Starting with a neighborhood size of ten buildings, several thousand
values must be collected. To reduce the effort required to create such a model
definition, it was divided into two process steps. All technology-specific
parameters are stored in the *standard_parameter.xlsx* and can be used across
models. These technology parameters are already implemented in the SESMG and
explained in detail in a documentation (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6974401).
Optionally, the technology parameters can be adapted by the users to vary technical
or economic parameters specific to the model or scenario (e.g. electricity import prices).
The individual input effort is thus limited to the neighborhood-specific data,
which must be defined as upscaling parameters. Here, building-specific parameters
are defined first (e.g. year of construction of a building). In addition, it is
defined for each building which technologies are available as investment alternative
s and are to be implemented in the energy system model (e.g. gas heating). Likewise,
a definition is made of the central components to be considered at the neighborhood
level (e.g. natural gas CHP). The input effort for the investment alternatives is
limited to a binary decision (yes/no). Central heat supply technologies can only
be considered as an investment alternative if a heat network is included in the
energy system model. With the help of the SESMG-internal upscaling tool, all
system components required for modeling the energy system are automatically
created and defined. Thus, users do not need to define the associated nodes and
edges of the energy system technologies as input data (see
`Structure of Energy Systems <https://spreadsheet-energy-system-model-generator.readthedocs.io/en/latest/01.01.00_structure_of_energy_systems.html>`_) [1].
The application is described here:  `Application Urban District Upscaling <https://spreadsheet-energy-system-model-generator.readthedocs.io/en/latest/02.02.00_application.html#urban-district-upscaling>`_.

The process diagram of the SESMG including the US-Tool is shown below. Two model
simplifications can be made in the upscaling sheet. Firstly, spatial sub-models
can be formed by deactivating certain buildings. Concrete examples would be a
preliminary study with, for example, five buildings or if a neighborhood with
900 buildings is divided into three sub-models with 300 buildings each. The
division into several sub-models saves random-access memory (RAM), so that the
models can be solved with the available computing capacities. Subsequently, the
results of the partial models are combined to an overall result. This results in
an inaccuracy, because there is no
interaction between the individual sub-models. Secondly, users may make technical
preselections in the upscaling sheet. For example, preliminary studies can lead
to the fact that no district heating network may be considered. All associated
technologies can then be deactivated in the upscaling sheet, so that the investment
decisions decrease.

Upscaling Model
===============

By using the urban Upscaling Tool, automatically a model containing the components
shown in the following figure is created. The model is divided into components of
the main-system which are created only once, and components of sub-systems, which
are created for every sub-system. A detailed description of the system is given
here: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7615332
