- **label**: The building name can be chosen by the user and is the identification number (ID) of a building. The ID must be unique for each building, because all the following columns are assigned to it.
- **comment**: Space for an individual comment, e.g. an indication of which measure this component belongs to.
- **active**: In this cell, users decide whether a building should be considered in the modeling.
- **year of construction**: The year of construction of a building is relevant for the calculation of the heat demand.
- **distance of electric vehicles (km/a)**: The annual kilometers driven are used to create the charging profile of an electric car. The electricity demand for the electric car is considered separately from the building electricity demand.
- **electricity demand (kWh / (m²  a))**: The specific electricity demand is multiplied by the useful building area to calculate the annual demand. If the annual electricity demand is not available as a function of the building floor area, 1 m² must be entered for the building floor area.
- **heat demand (kWh / (m² a))**: The specific heat demand is multiplied by the useful building area to calculate the annual demand. If the annual heat demand is not available as a function of the building floor area, 1 m² must be entered for the building floor area.
- **building type**: The building usage influences the calculation of the energy demand and the selection of the load profile for buildings. The different building types can be found in the standard parameter documentation (see `standard parameter`_). The following input values are valid: SFB, MFB, COM_Food, COM_Retail, COM_Office, COM_School, COM_Stable, COM_Sports, COM_Workshop, COM_Restaurant and COM_Hotel.
- **units**: The number of housing units is required for calculating the heat demand of residential buildings.
- **occupants per unit**: The occupants per housing unit are required to calculate the electricity demand of the households. If the occupants per housing unit are multiplied by the housing units, the number of occupants per building can be calculated. The summed occupants of all buildings represent the total modeled neighborhood residents and provide a good basis for validation with real data.
- **gross building area	(m²)**: The gross building area is required to calculate the annual electricity and heat demand of commercial buildings and the heat demand of residential buildings. For this purpose, the gross building area is multiplied by the specific electricity and heat demand and a building area factor (see `standard parameter`_). The building area factor depends on the building use and reduces the gross building area by non-usable areas such as the base areas of walls.
- **latitude	(° WGS 84)**: The latitude of the building are required to connect the building to a heating network. In addition, the coordinates are used to obtain weather data for PV systems from an external database. The World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS 84) is used as a reference system.
- **longitude	(° WGS 84)**: The longitude of the building are required to connect the building to a heating network. In addition, the coordinates are used to obtain weather data for PV systems from an external database. The World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS 84) is used as a reference system.
- **year of construction wall**: The year of construction of a walls is relevant for the calculation of the savings potential of insulation measures. For each building, the U-value (also heat transfer coefficient) is obtained from the standard parameter sheet (see `standard parameter`_), depending on the year of construction of the building. In the Energy Saving Ordinance 2014, U-values are defined to achieve the desirable efficiency level 1. These U-values can be maximally achieved in the modeling. The difference between current and minimum U-value is the possible saving of heat demand. The calculation is explained in the standard parameter documentation (see `standard parameter`_).
- **area outer wall	(m²)**: The external wall area is relevant for the calculation of insulation measures.
- **year of construction windows**: The year of construction of windows is relevant for the calculation of the savings potential of insulation measures. For each building, the U-value (also heat transfer coefficient) is obtained from the standard parameter sheet (see `standard parameter`_), depending on the year of construction of the building. In the Energy Saving Ordinance 2014, U-values are defined to achieve the desirable efficiency level 1. These U-values can be maximally achieved in the modeling. The difference between current and minimum U-value is the possible saving of heat demand. The calculation is explained in the standard parameter documentation (see `standard parameter`_).
- **area windows	(m²)**: The window area is relevant for the calculation of insulation measures.
- **year of construction roof**: The year of construction of a roof is relevant for the calculation of the savings potential of insulation measures. For each building, the U-value (also heat transfer coefficient) is obtained from the standard parameter sheet (see `standard parameter`_), depending on the year of construction of the building. In the Energy Saving Ordinance 2014, U-values are defined to achieve the desirable efficiency level 1. These U-values can be maximally achieved in the modeling. The difference between current and minimum U-value is the possible saving of heat demand. The calculation is explained in the standard parameter documentation (see `standard parameter`_).
- **rooftype**: The roof type is differentiated between flat roofs and step roofs. The roof type is relevant for the calculation of insulation measures.
- **area roof	(m²)**: The roof areas are relevant for the calculation of insulation measures.
- **cluster ID**: The cluster ID is used to spatially assign a building to a specific area. The area can be, for example, a settlement or neighborhood. The cluster ID is crucial for spatial clustering.
- **flow temperature	(°C)**: The flow temperature may differ depending on the heating system. The flow temperature should not fall below the heat source temperature of a heat pump. If the outdoor temperature is 35 °C and the flow temperature is 30 °C, the air heat pump is switched off and an alternative technology is used for heat supply.
- **electricity cost (€/kWh)**: If the user wants to use a electricity purchase price that differs from the standard parameter (e.g. due to a green electricity tariff), this can be entered here. If not the user has to enter "standard".
- **electricity emission (g/kWh)**: If the user wants to use a electricity purchase emission that differs from the standard parameter (e.g. due to a green electricity tariff), this can be entered here. If not the user has to enter "standard".
- **heatpump electricity cost (€/kWh)**: If the user wants to use a heatpump electricity purchase price that differs from the standard parameter (e.g. due to a different heatpump tariff), this can be entered here. If not the user has to enter "standard".
- **heatpump electricity emission (g/kWh)**: If the user wants to use a heatpump electricity purchase emission that differs from the standard parameter (e.g. due to a different heatpump tariff), this can be entered here. If not the user has to enter "standard".

- **label**: The building name can be chosen by the user and is the identification number (ID) of a building. The ID must be unique for each building, because all the following columns are assigned to it.
- **ashp**: Air source heat pumps (ASHP) can be considered in the optimization of a building if the air-regenerated noise of the fans does not exceed the limits of the Technical Instructions on Noise Abatement (TA Lärm). There are already some ASHP on the market that meet the requirements.
- **gchp**: Ground-coupled heat pumps are limited by the area required for geothermal collectors or probes. If there is a potential area for the GCHP, the so-called parcel must be assigned to the buildings.
- **parcel ID**: The parcel ID assigns a potential area for GCHP to the buildings. On an additional auxiliary data sheet, users enter the parcel ID and the potential area.
- **heat extraction (kW/m)**: The extraction capacity of the geothermal probes or collectors is crucial for the performance of the heat pumps. The extraction rate should be determined specifically for the location.

- **wood stove share**: If a value between 0 and 1 is used as "wood stove share", this share is separated from the main household heat demand and connected primarily to the wood stove. To avoid insolubility, this bus is also connected to the main heating bus of the considered building. If this division of the sink is not desired, "standard" should be used.
- **solar thermal share**: If a value between 0 and 1 is used as "solar thermal share", this share is separated from the main household heat demand and connected primarily to the solar thermal collector. To avoid insolubility, this bus is also connected to the main heating bus of the considered building. If this division of the sink is not desired, "standard" should be used.
- **st 1**: In this column it is decided whether the roof potential area applies to solar thermal (ST) systems. Possible entries: yes or no.
- **pv 1**: In this column it is decided whether the roof potential area applies to photovoltaic (PV) systems. Possible entries: yes or no. As soon as both systems are relevant for one area, an area competition arises, which is automatically considered.
- **roof area 1	(m²)**: The roof potential area of a building can be divided into several partial roof areas with respect to the radiation intensity. In total, users can add 30 partial roof areas.
- **surface tilt 1	(°)**: The surface tilt is decisive for the dimensioning of the solar systems and depends on the construction of the roof.
- **azimuth 1	(°)**: The azimuth is also critical to solar system sizing and depends on the orientation of the building.
